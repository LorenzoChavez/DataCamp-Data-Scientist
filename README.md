# DataCamp: Data Scientist Career

This repository contains scripts of all the excercises I have completed from [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/home). Each course has its own statement of accomplishment and after finishing all of them I obtained following certificates:
- [Data Scientist with Python](https://github.com/LorenzoChavez/DataCamp-Data-Scientist/blob/master/data-science-with-python.pdf): *22 courses ~ 80h*
- [Data Scientist with R](https://github.com/LorenzoChavez/DataCamp-Data-Scientist/blob/master/data-science-with-R.pdf) *22  courses - 80h*
