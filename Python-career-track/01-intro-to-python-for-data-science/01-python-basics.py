# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Put code below here
print(7 + 10)

# Just testing division
print(5 / 8)

#Addition works too

# Addition and subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication and division
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Exponentiation
print(4 ** 2)

# Modulo
print(18 % 7)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Print out savings
print(savings)

# Create a variable savings
savings = 100

# Create a variable factor
factor = 1.10

# Calculate result
result = savings * factor ** 7

# Print out result

# Create a variable desc
desc = 'compound interest'

# Create a variable profitable
profitable = True

# Several variables to experiment with
savings = 100

# Assign product of factor and savings to year1
year1 = savings * factor

# Print the type of year1

doubledesc = desc + desc

# Print out doubledesc

# Definition of savings and result

# Fix the printout
